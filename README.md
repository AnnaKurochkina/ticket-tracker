# React Prpject - Ticket Tracker

## Requirements
1.  Should be built in React
2.  Each component should manage its own state
3.  The components should be generated using a map()

## Overview
AS AN employee  
I WANT to keep a count of all the tickets I have completed  
SO THAT I can manage my workflow

AS AN employee  
I WANT to be able to track the number of tickets my coworkers have completed  
SO THAT I can compare the number of tickets we complete 

Your task is to create a ticket tracking system. Each employee is on the data file and should be able to
increment/decrement their ticket count. Please see the attached image.

## Plan

  * Create the components you think you will need (at least an employee component, possibly more)
  * Map over the data file below to create the components
  * Pass data into them via props
  * Use State to handle the increment and decrement of tickets
  * Style it however you like, but donâ€™t leave it blank
